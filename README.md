# delete-specs
A node script to delete .spec.ts test files in Angular. Folder to delete in is passed as an argument

I originally wrote this is JS and then converted it to TS. Some observations:

How much time spent wrestling with TS types is worth it? Sometimes it seems like the best part of TS is that it makes developers more aware of types in general, but at the end of the day, they're more like guidelines are helpers than hard and fast things. One of JS's best features is its dynamicism. Does TS reduce the dynamicism of JS? It seems like it might.
